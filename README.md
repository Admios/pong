# Congratulations!

It seems you are curious about our Pong game implementation! We like curious minds, so here are a few things you can try to impress us with:

- Add arrow keys support to move the player paddle
- increase AI efficiency when game level has increased
- Revise the Object Oriented Model used to represent the game and its primitives
- Add game side state management solution
- modify the ballâ€™s speed and trajectory when hit by a paddle factoring in the paddle speed and direction


## scripts

To quickly browse the game:

```yarn start:dev```


Once, you got it open in the browser, the following commands will watch and recompile and code changes you make:

```yarn watch:dev```

To Build in production mode (minified JavaScript):

```yarn build:prod```
